COSC 310 Project: Maximum Bot

To run: include all project files, and run the project (as per submitted readme)

Starting the chat is straightforward, as it was in the last 2 iterations of this project.

To access the Yahoo Answers mode, simply type a phrase with the word 'question' in it.
To access the Wikipedia mode, type the name of Batman's enemies or allies.  For instance, typing a phrase containing 'joker' will return the Wikipedia entry for The Joker.

Using the voice dictation is simple; look at the console for cues.  When it prints "I'm listening", you are free to speak.  When it prints "I'm done listening", it sends the data to Google.  If it says "I didn't catch that", it means that you'll need to enter manually what you wish to say to the bot.

Any other information should be in the sumbitted documentation.
